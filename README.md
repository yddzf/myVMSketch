Our source code consists of five files, where File "GeneralHash.cpp" implements the functionality of the hash function, and File "kPersistent.cpp" implements the pseudocode from the paper. Specifically, the function HashTableInsert in File "kPersistent.cpp" implements the recording process for each element of flows, while the function EstimatedKSpread in File "kPersistent.cpp" implements the spread query functionality for any given flow.
